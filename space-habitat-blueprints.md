## O'Neill Cylinder:
  -- Proposed by physicist Gerad K. O'Neill, these are large rotating cylinders that simulate gravity through centripetal force. The interior surface of the cylinder would be inhabitated, and sunlight would be reflected into the habitat through mirrors.

  ## Stanford Torus:
    -- Similiar to O'Neill Cylinders, the Stanford Torus is a donut-shaped space habitat. It rotates to generate artificial gravity and features a central hub that could house various facilities.
