## Physics and Mathematics:
  -- Simulating interstellar travel requires a deep understanding of physics and mathmatics, particularly in the areas of general relativity and celestial mechanics.

-- Special relativity becomes crucial at high speeds, and understanding the time dilation effects is essential.
## Astrodynamics:
-- Astrodynamics involves the study of the motion of objects in space. Simulations need to account for gravitational forces from multiple celestial bodies, propulsion systems, and their effects on the trajectory.
